# Flappy-Bird

Flappy-Bird via Java

This Java code defines a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Swing for graphical interface and basic Java for game logic.

Where the player controls a bird to avoid pipes, and the score increases as the bird passes through pipes. When the bird collides with a pipe or goes out of bounds,
the game ends, and appropriate music is played. The player can restart the game by pressing the spacebar.

Java Swing, Graphics Handling, Event Handling, Timers, Audio Processing, and more have been utilized.
